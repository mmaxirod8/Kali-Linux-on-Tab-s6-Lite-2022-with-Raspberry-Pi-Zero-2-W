# Kali Linux on Android with Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W --> Hacking without a "PC"
### 📌 Here you can see how I implemented a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W with Kali Linux OS (for this board) using a Samsung tablet Tab S6 Lite 2022 Edition as terminal/monitor with VNC & Termux

### 🛒 Things we need
First, we need the following components to carry out the project:
- `Raspberry Pi Zero 2W`
- `Power cable` for the Raspberry Pi
- `Raspberry Pi Imager` software for PC
- `SD card` (any size, 64GB recommended) for the Raspberry Pi
- `SD card holder` (to load the Kali Linux OS from Raspberry Pi Imager using your PC)
- `Tablet or mobile` (Android) device (in this case we used Samsung Tab S6 Lite 2022 version)
- `VNC` app for our device (RVNC Viewer on the Play Store) in which we are going to see the GUI of our OS
- `Termux` app for our device (to establish the SSH connection and commands)
- Connection to the `same Wi-Fi network` (between the tablet and the Raspberry Pi)

### 🔎 What's the first step here?
Once you have everything you need, proceed as follows:
- Download `Raspberry Pi Imager` to your PC from: https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/. This software allows you to install any operating system on your board; in this case, Kali Linux for the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W.
- Once the app is installed, connect your SD card to an SD card reader and then connect the reader to your computer.
- Return to the Raspberry Pi software and go to the `OS` or "Operating Systems" menu. Select `Other specific-purpose OS` and find `Kali Linux` among the options. Then, search for `Raspberry Pi Zero 2W` (Kali Linux ARM image for the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W).
