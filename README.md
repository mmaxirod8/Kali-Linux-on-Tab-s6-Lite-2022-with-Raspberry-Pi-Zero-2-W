# Kali Linux on Samsung Tab S6 with Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W --> Hacking without a "PC"
### 📌 Here you can see how I implemented a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W with Kali Linux OS (for this board) using a Samsung tablet Tab S6 Lite 2022 Edition as monitor via VNC

### 🛒 Things we need
First, we need the following components to carry out the project:
- Raspberry Pi Zero 2W
- Power cable for the Raspberry Pi
- Raspberry Pi Imager Software (PC)
- SD card (any size, 64GB recommended) for the Raspberry Pi
- SD card holder (to load the Kali Linux OS from Raspberry Pi Imager using your PC)
- Tablet or mobile device that can download/run the VNC app (RVNC Viewer on the Play Store)
- Termux for Android (to establish the SSH connection and commands)
- Connection to the same Wi-Fi network (between the tablet and the Raspberry Pi)

### 🔎 What's the first step here?
Once you have everything you need, proceed as follows:
- Download "Raspberry Pi Imager" to your PC. This software allows you to install any operating system on your board; in this case, Kali Linux for the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W.
- Once the app is installed, connect your SD card to an SD card reader and then connect the reader to your computer.
- Return to the Raspberry Pi software and go to the "OS" or "Operating Systems" menu. Select "Other specific-purpose OS" and find "Kali Linux" among the options. Then, search for "Raspberry Pi Zero 2W" (Kali Linux ARM image for the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W).
